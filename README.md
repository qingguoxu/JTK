# JTK
This is a project for research purperse. 
		By monitoring human’s temperature, we can figure out correlation between the temperature
		trend and human’s health. The researchers collect temperature data using a wearable sensor. I’m the programmer 
		in this project, and develop a GUI program implementing the Jonckheere-Terpstra-Kendall (JTK) algorithm to 
		analyze raw temperature data and figure out the 
		amplitude and period of the temperature trend automatically.
